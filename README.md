# Advent of code 2017

[UPC ACM Student Chapter](www.upcacm.org) repository with crowdsourced solutions for the [Advent of Code 2017](http://adventofcode.com/2017/about)

Advent of Code is a series of small programming puzzles for a variety of skill levels. They are self-contained and are just as appropriate for an expert who wants to stay sharp as they are for a beginner who is just learning to code. Each puzzle calls upon different skills and has two parts that build on a theme.

In this repository you will find solutions made by students and professionals from the BarcelonaTech university.

If you are an student and you want to contribute or improve some solution we love pull requests!!
